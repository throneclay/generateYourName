# generateYourName
This is my first python program. It can combine different English word into one name so that you can pick one looks coolly to you.

##Dependences:

This program dependents on validate_email and whois, checkout the internet to install so you can run this.

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/validate_email

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-whois

##Todo:
This program can test the domain of this name to find out if this domain has been taken.(green is available, red is taken)
But the email test has something wrong. It is always red! I haven't find out what is wrong.
